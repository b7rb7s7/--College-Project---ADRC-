# emulate_users.sh

This is a simple Bash script I used in a college project. At our professorâ€™s request, for grading and evaluation purposes, I am uploading it to GitHub. The script "emulates" multiple users accessing a web server by running multiple instances of the ping command. It was designed to be used in a controlled environment with its own predefined variables.


Usage: ./emulate_users.sh <destination> <instances> <min_time> <max_time> <packet_size> <duration_seconds> <output_file>

# plots
