# ADR_Project_Emulate_Users__
This is a simple Bash script I used in a college project. At our professorâ€™s request, I am uploading it to GitHub.  The script "emulates" multiple users accessing a web server by running multiple instances of the ping command. It was designed to be used in a controlled environment with its own predefined variables.
